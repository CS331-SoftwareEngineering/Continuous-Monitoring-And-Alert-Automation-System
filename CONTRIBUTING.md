## Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Branching Strategy

- Do NOT push directly to `main`.
- Create a new branch for every feature or fix.

Example:
```
feature/login-validation
fix/api-error-handling
docs/update-srs
```

---

### 2. Commit Message Format

Use clear and meaningful commit messages.

Examples:
- Add login validation
- Fix password reset bug
- Update SRS documentation
- Refactor authentication module


Avoid vague messages like:
- changes
- update
- fix


---

### 3. Code Standards

- Maintain modular structure.
- Keep functions small and readable.
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Avoid hardcoded values.
- Comment only when necessary (write clean code instead).

---

### 4. Pull Requests

Before creating a pull request:

- Ensure the code runs without errors.
- Test your feature locally.
- Make sure no unnecessary files are included.
- Provide a clear description of what was implemented.

---

### 5. Documentation Updates

If your contribution changes system behavior or structure:

- Update `README.md`
- Update SRS (if required)
- Update relevant diagrams (DFD/UML)

---

## Reporting Issues

- Clearly describe the issue.
